# Advent of Code 2020

This repo contains my solutions or attempts at solutions for the 25 days of
coding problems from https://adventofcode.com/2020. I will try to copy the
problem description into `problem.txt` for all the problems as I remember.

There are subfolders for each day each containing input and (probably) a python
file driving the solution. Parts 1 and 2 are run manually by changing code
:shrug:. I might make it more automatic as the days go on.

Enjoy!
